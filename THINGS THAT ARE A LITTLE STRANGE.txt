THINGS THAT ARE A LITTLE STRANGE

Serving up files from client folder and also node_modules seperately didn't seem to work
  but then putting client side seperately into bower_components did
  and can't just serve up bower_components file, have to have index.html in filepath

Where are the filepaths relative to?
  from the file that references it? from where the server is set up?
